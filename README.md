# Shaking the Data: A Global Analysis of Earthquake Patterns

This project explores global earthquake data using R (dplyr + ggplot2).  
I analyzed magnitude, depth, and regional distribution to uncover patterns in seismic activity.

## Tools Used
- R
- dplyr
- ggplot2

## Key Insights
- Japan had the highest number of earthquakes
- No strong correlation between depth and magnitude

## Status
✅ Complete | 📁 Portfolio-ready
